#### 2025-05-25: Collaborative Web Crawler Project Planning (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Goal**: Establish comprehensive architecture for educational web crawler targeting 50M pages/24h
- **Key Events**: Created modular design with SQLite backend, established database schema, implemented basic modules
- **Technical Decisions**: Chose SQLite for simplicity, asyncio for concurrency, flat file storage for content
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Human provided Nielsen benchmark context, leading to revised realistic expectation of 5-15M pages/24h
- **State**: Basic project structure with config, storage, frontier, and utility modules ready for core implementation

#### 2025-05-31: Designing New Datastore Architecture (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Create database-agnostic architecture supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL for scaling
- **Architecture**: Abstract `DatabaseBackend` with SQLiteBackend and PostgreSQLBackend implementations
- **Configuration**: Added `db_type` and `db_url` parameters with PostgreSQL URL validation
- **Performance**: PostgreSQL configured with `synchronous_commit = OFF`, optimized memory settings
- **State**: Successfully abstracted database layer, ready for PostgreSQL deployment beyond ~100 workers

#### 2025-05-31: Optimizing Web Crawler Frontier (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Eliminate "thundering herd" problem in frontier queue management
- **Problem**: N workers competing for URL 1, then N-1 for URL 2, creating O(NÂ²) failed attempts
- **Solution**: Two-phase atomic batch claiming with 5-minute expiry for failed workers
- **Innovation**: Added `claimed_at` timestamp column with graceful unclaiming for unready domains
- **Architecture**: Reduced database contention through batch processing and worker identification
- **State**: Frontier contention significantly reduced, improved scalability for high worker counts

#### 2025-06-08: Debugging Race Condition (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Fix race condition in concurrent URL claiming mechanism
- **Problem**: Multiple workers claiming same URL IDs due to improper `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- **Root Cause**: Locks applied to CTE results, not actual table rows
- **Solution**: Rewrote queries to apply locks directly to table rows, simplified structure
- **State**: Race conditions addressed, improved PostgreSQL performance under high concurrency

#### 2025-06-10: Integrating Metrics Collection (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Replace log-based metrics with comprehensive Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- **Achievement**: Complete monitoring stack with Docker Compose, pre-configured dashboards
- **Innovation**: Counters, gauges, histograms integrated throughout crawler lifecycle
- **Technical Decision**: Industry-standard monitoring on port 8001 with minimal overhead
- **State**: Real-time performance visibility and historical data analysis capability

#### 2025-06-13: Rethinking Web Crawler Architecture (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Address performance bottleneck (86 vs 20 pages/sec target)
- **Discovery**: DB connection acquisition time (P50=1881ms) was main issue, not database performance
- **Root Cause**: Connection pool starvation (500 workers, only 80 connections)
- **Decision**: Recommended PostgreSQL optimization before Redis migration
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL tuning for 64GB RAM, 800 max connections
- **State**: Identified path to performance improvement through connection pool scaling

#### 2025-06-14: Start Phase 2 Redis Rearchitecture (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Implement Redis-backed frontier manager
- **Innovation**: HybridFrontierManager using Redis metadata + filesystem URL storage
- **Design**: Redis sorted sets for scheduling, bloom filters for deduplication
- **Achievement**: 9 passing tests, maintained interface compatibility for easy integration
- **State**: Frontier component successfully migrated to Redis hybrid architecture

#### 2025-06-18: Reviewing Redis Implementation (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Clean up inefficient code patterns from PostgreSQL migration
- **Fix**: Removed broken `_populate_seen_urls_from_redis()`, simplified deduplication
- **Decision**: Kept distributed locks for multi-operation functions despite Redis atomicity
- **State**: Redis architecture working with optimized code patterns

#### 2025-06-28: Debugging File Descriptor Leak (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Investigate FD leak growing from 1,500 to 4,000+ over 11 hours
- **Suspected Sources**: aiohttp connections, Redis clients, frontier files
- **Plan**: Add FD tracking by component, investigate parser process cleanup
- **State**: FD leak identified as major performance degradation source

#### 2025-06-29: Debugging Redis Crash (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Debug unexpected Redis restart causing crawler crash
- **Problem**: Redis restarted at 15:57, causing "Redis is loading dataset" errors
- **Plan**: Implement retry logic, Redis health monitoring, high availability
- **State**: Vulnerability to Redis failures identified, resilience mechanisms needed

#### 2025-06-29: Diagnosing Memory Issues (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Investigate memory growth in long-running crawler
- **Approach**: Memory tracking by component, periodic dumps and analysis
- **Focus**: HTML content lifecycle, Redis connections, file handles
- **State**: Memory management issues affecting long-running stability

#### 2025-06-29: Finding Redis Server Data Snapshots (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Analyze Redis persistence to understand restart behavior
- **Focus**: Redis .rdb files, backup location, save configuration
- **Plan**: Backup and recovery procedures, monitoring and alerting
- **State**: Need better understanding of Redis data persistence and recovery

#### 2025-06-30: Rebalancing Web Crawler Processes (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Optimize process allocation between fetching and parsing
- **Problem**: Parser consumers falling behind fetcher producers
- **Approach**: Dynamic worker scaling, CPU affinity, NUMA topology consideration
- **State**: Suboptimal process balance causing parsing bottleneck

#### 2025-07-01: Optimize Web Crawler Memory Usage (Claude 4 Opus)
- **Goal**: Reduce Redis memory from ~21GB to ~13.5GB by removing redundant fields
- **Achievement**: Removed redundant `visited:*` hash fields saving ~35% memory
- **Optimization**: Eliminated content hash computation (1% CPU savings in parser)
- **Innovation**: 2000-character URL length limit preventing memory bloat
- **State**: Memory-optimized with backward compatibility and migration script
